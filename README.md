# jQuery Visualizations
I wrote this code, apparently, quite a while ago. Looking at this code seven years later, to my surprise, I found that everything still works and they are all still fun to watch. The goal of this project was to become comfortable with jQuery and more specifically jQuery `animate`. Essentially these are just tech demos that taught me a little bit while writing them.

Enjoy!

## Organization
There are four projects contained within:
- Ice Crystals (ice_crystals.html)
- Letters (letters.html)
- Lightning (lightning.html)
- Mouse Interaction (mouse_interaction.html)
- Stars (stars.html)

Each `.html` file has a corresponding `.js` file in the `js` folder in the root of this repository.

## Running
All visualizations can be run simply by opening the corresponding `.html` file in the root of this repository. Some require interaction, some do not.

The only one that needs much explanation is `Letters`. To interact with this visualization simply type any letter key after it the `Loading...` message disappears.

## Requirements
The only real requirement is that you be connected to the internet while running these simulations. jQuery is sourced via `googleapis` URLs. At some point I should just included the version of jQuery required for this repository locally so it will work as long as the browsers support it.
